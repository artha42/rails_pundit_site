  %p RailsPundit helps you learn rails the agile way and become a pundit yourself. The ecosystem around Ruby and Rails is exploding. It can be quite frustrating and overwhelming for a user when getting started with Rails looking at the sheer amount of choices. Also most of the information required to quickly launch is fragmented. Given our experience, we understand that the task of creating compelling applications for clients or your customers involves aspects like Requirements Management, Team Composition, Project Management process, Change control process apart from the solution itself.
